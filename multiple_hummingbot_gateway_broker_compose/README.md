# Deploy Hummingbot + Gateway + Broker Instances

This installs a [Hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) instance linked to a [Hummingbot Gateway](https://github.com/hummingbot/gateway) instance, along with an EMQX [Broker](https://github.com/hummingbot/brokers).

!!! note "Experimental deployment"
    This deployment is still undergoing testing, so we recommend using the standalone deployments for message brokers from the [hummingbot/brokers](https://github.com/hummingbot/brokers) repository.

## Prerequisites

This configuration requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.

See [Docker](../DOCKER.md) for more information about how to install and use Docker Compose, as well as helpful commands.

## Getting Started

This configuration lets you orchestrate Hummingbot and Gateway instances using an EMQX broker.

To enable this, you will do need a few things first:
- Install and configure the Hummingbot and Gateway instances
- Generate self-signed certificates in Hummingbot
- Give Gateway the passphrase used to generate the certificates (`GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE`)
- Configure the EMQX broker

Verify that Docker Compose is installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
docker compose version
```

The output should be: `Docker Compose version v2.17.2` or similar. Ensure that you are using Docker Compose V2, as V1 is deprecated.

### 1. Launch network

Clone this repo to your machine and go to the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples.git
cd deploy-examples/hummingbot_gateway_broker_compose
```

Alternatively, copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to a directory on your machine where you want to store your Hummingbot files. 

This is the "root folder" where your encrypted keys, scripts, trades, configs, logs, and other files related to your bots will be saved.

From the root folder, run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:
```
docker compose up -d
```

After the images have been downloaded, you should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 4/4
 ⠿ Network hummingbot_gateway_broker_compose_default      Created
 ⠿ Container hummingbot                                   Started
 ⠿ Container gateway                                      Started
 ⠿ Container emqx                                         Started      
```

### 2. Set permissions

Run this command from your root folder to grant read/write permission to the `hummingbot_files` and `gateway_files` sub-folders:
```
sudo chmod -R a+rw ./hummingbot_files ./gateway_files
```


### 3. Launch Hummingbot and generate certificates

Now, attach to the `hummingbot` instance:
```
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should see the Hummingbot welcome screen:

![welcome screen](../welcome.png)

Set your Hummingbot [password](https://docs.hummingbot.org/operation/password/) and write it down. This is the `CONFIG_PASSWORD` environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

Run the following command to generate Gateway certificates:
```
gateway generate-certs
```

Afterwards, run `exit` to exit Hummingbot. 

### 4. Remove network

Once you're back in Bash/Terminal, run the following command to remove the Compose project:
```
docker compose down
```
You should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 4/3 
 ⠿ Container hummingbot                                         Removed
 ⠿ Container gateway                                            Removed
 ⠿ Container emqx                                               Removed
 ⠿ Network hummingbot_gateway_broker_compose_default            Removed
```  

### 5. Modify YAML file

Now, use an IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Edit the section that defines the `CONFIG_PASSWORD` and `CONFIG_FILE_NAME` environment variables:
```yaml
  hummingbot:
    # environment:
      #  - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
  gateway:
    # environment:
      #  - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=a
```

Uncomment out:
 * The `environment:` lines
 * The `CONFIG_PASSWORD` lines: add your Hummingbot password
 * The `GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE` line: add the passphrase you used to generate the certificates

The final `environment` section of the YAML file should look like this:
```yaml
  bot:
    environment:
      - CONFIG_PASSWORD=a
  gateway:
    environment:
      - GATEWAY_PASSPHRASE=a
```

Afterwards, save the file.

### 6. Recreate network

Now, recreate the Compose project:
```
docker compose up -d
```


Attach to the `hummingbot` instance. If you have defined `CONFIG_PASSWORD` in the YAML file, you don't need to enter it again:
```
docker attach hummingbot
```

After you enter your password, you should now see `GATEWAY:ONLINE` in the upper-right hand corner.

Open a new Terminal/Bash window. In it, attach to the Gateway `gateway` instance to see its logs:
```
docker attach gateway
```

See [Gateway](https://docs.hummingbot.org/gateway/) for more details on how to configure it for use with Hummingbot.

To get started with Hummingbot, check out the following docs:

* [Basic Features](https://docs.hummingbot.org/operation/)
* [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.hummingbot.org/quickstart/)
* [Hummingbot FAQ](https://docs.hummingbot.org/faq/)

### 7. Configure EMQX Broker

Attach to the EMQX Broker `emqx` instance:
```
docker attach emqx
```

Navigate to the EMQX dashboard to configure authentication and available ports at http://localhost:18083/. 

The default credentials for connecting to the dashboards are `admin:public`. 

For connecting your bots via MQTT, just leave the `mqtt_username` and `mqtt_password` parameters of the bot empty.
